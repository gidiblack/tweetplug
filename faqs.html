                        <p>That is all!! You are done for the day. You will be credited with your revenue share before the end of the day if you did your work right.</p>

                        <p>NO, we do not have any referral program neither are we planning to introduce anything like that. If you trust us enough you can introduce Tweetplug as a source of income to your family and friends but we do not pay commission on that, we only pay you for promoting a business.</p>

                        <h3>Why am I allowed to tweet only 3 times in a day?</h3>
                        <p>We do not encourage spamming at all, so all users are only allowed to tweet 3 sponsored adverts in a day.</p>
                        <h3 class="pt-2">Do I have to submit my tweet links daily?</h3>
                        <p>It is absolutely necessary to submit your tweet links daily, because that is the only way we can confirm that you have completed your task and process your revenue share(payment).</p>

                        <p>You will not get paid for that day. Please note that you will only get paid when you tweet and get the required number of retweets on each tweet. If you do not tweet, we will not get paid and we won’t be able to you.</p>

                        <p>We have a WhatsApp group to help customers with their required retweets on each tweet, after you subscribe you can request to join the group. Please follow the group rules in order not to be kicked out.</p>

                        <p>If you ever have a problem or want to make an enquiry, please call or message the Admin or any of the Frontmen and you will be attended to properly. If you complain and your problem does not get resolved, please send a mail to us describing your problem and include the name of the frontman you complained to. We have trained all our frontmen so anyone you contact should be able to assist and solve your problem.</p>

                        <h3>Are we going to last? are we legit?</h3>
                        <p>This is a funny question because every platform would tell you that they will last just to get you to subscribe but I just want to let you know that we despise scammers and we are very passionate about what we do. We are growing fast and we’ve got something great here on a grand scale and we don’t plan to fuck that up. We plan to last not just for days or months but we plan to last for years and we cannot go that far without your cooperation so we need you to have our backs the same way we have yours. We would not abandon you, we are here to stay. We promise to be honest with our dealings.</p>

                        <h3>What happens if I submit a wrong link?</h3>
                        <p>If you submit a wrong link by mistake, please contact a frontman immediately so we don’t deactivate your account but if you submit a wrong link and don’t notify us then we notice, your account would be deactivated immediately.</p>
                        <h3 class="pt-3">We are open to suggestions:</h3>
                        <p>Please if you ever have a suggestion for us or have any advice on how we can improve on a particular aspect, feel free to reach out to us either by mail or on any of our social media platform.</p>

                        <h3>Should I be scared to join this platform? Will Tweetplug crash?</h3>
                        <p>Have you heard this quote by Brian Tracy that goes “whatever we expect with confidence becomes our own self-fulfilling prophecy”? Well that’s simply saying that if you expect us to crash and you go about saying it with confidence then your prophecy might come to pass, you cannot want us to succeed but be expecting us to fail so please let’s avoid saying that sentence because Tweetplug will not crash and that’s on God.</p>
                        <p><em>-Life is a self-fulfilling prophecy. What you believe about life will be your experience of life - Donald Walsch</em></p>
                        <p>Lastly we promise not to disappoint those who have been disappointed by online businesses in the past and still thought to give us a chance.</p>

                        <h3>Why am I just making 50% returns on my investment/subscription? Would it go lower than 50%?</h3>
                        <p>We would not promise you what we cannot pay you and 50% profit is our offer so if you are okay with making 50% profit on your investment every month then you have come to the right place but if it is too small for you and you want more then you are in the wrong place. Also, we can assure you that there isn’t any legitimate online platform that would reward you over 50% return on investment per month, even experienced foreign exchange traders or cryptocurrency traders that risk 1-10% of their capital trading don’t make 50% profit in a month. So please if you are not okay with our offer, you can find another place to invest your money.</p>
                        <p>Lastly there might be sometimes where we would have to pay lower than 50% profit in a month but be rest assured that you would still make very good profit in that month and we would never reduce the profit percentage without informing you first via email.</p>
